# My Creative Work
This repository is generally a portfolio on all my creative work. In here I have medias ranging from acrylic/oil paintings, graphic designs, and photography to name a few. Some of this work was created during my time as a Communications & Advertising Manager Chair under UC Merced's Campus Activities Board. Other work is purely out of enjoyment of creating.
